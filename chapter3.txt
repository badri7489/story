It is a very simple machine learning algorithm used to solve classification problems. Mainly the classifiction is of 0/1, yes/no, true/false, or any classification which is binary. It uses the sigmoid function which converts all the predictions to 0-1 range. Therefore all the values are categorised on the basis of a mid range between 0 and 1 that is 0.5. So all the values above 0.5 are considered 1 and all values below or 0.5 is considered 0.
